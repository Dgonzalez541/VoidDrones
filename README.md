# Void Drones

### Context
Void Drones is primarily an exploration into Unreal Engine 5 and its toolset with an emphasis on best practices for large projects. The project was based off of the Lyra Starter Game. Released by Unreal, it focuses on providing a platform from which to build sophisticated experiences. Great care was taken to properly extend this project in a way that future updates and maintenance can be performed.

### Gameplay
Void Drones is a fast paced third person shooter with a focus on vertical movement. The player chooses a class that has its own weapons and abilities, and then has to survive waves of flying drones. When all the drones are dead, the player wins.All weapons, abilities, and level design are focused on making the player stay actively moving more than in most arena shooters. Platforms are small, exposed, and always moving. Failure to do so, drops the player into open spaces with no cover, or off of the map. To compensate for this demand, movement options are extremely generous. Players have access to grapple hooks, ziplines, gliders, dashes, rocket jumps, and more. With the easy movement options, sparse cover, and aggressive flying enemies, the player should have their attention evenly split between shooting and actively using abilities to maneuver.

Visual elements should glow when possible. The main level, Hourglass, consists of two black holes positioned vertically. Flowing from the bottom black hole to the top is a stream of particles that the player can ride. Around this stream are various circular segments that are presumably some kind of machine. These segments are the platforms of the level. The arrangement is meant to resemble an hourglass with the sand/particles flowing up. When the match time is half over, the level then rotates like an hourglass. The players have to deal with this, or fall off the map.

### The Drones

Enemies should also visually reflect the level they exist in. In Hourglass, the drones use the same blackholes and rotating machinery that the level has.Attacks can come from any direction so ample visual and auditory cues are necessary to ensure the player can react to attacks.  The drones change color and give an auditory cue before an attack.  Laser attacks are performed as large sweeping beams that the player can avoid. The attacks start near the player, and follow in a way that the player can avoid.
